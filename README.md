    Libraries:
        pandas, numpy: For data processing.
        seaborn, matplotlib: For EDA.
        sklearn: For preprocessing, splitting data, and building models.

2. Loading the Dataset

    Description: Reads a CSV file containing customer data for predicting credit mix.

3. Data Preprocessing

    Handling Missing Values:
        Numerical columns: Missing values are filled with the mean.
        Categorical columns: Missing values are filled with the mode.
    Encoding Categorical Variables:
        Uses LabelEncoder to convert categorical features into numerical values.
    Scaling Numeric Features:
        Scales features to standardize data using StandardScaler.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Visualizes the distribution of the target variable (Credit_Mix) using a count plot.
    Plots a heatmap to show correlations between features.

5. Splitting the Dataset

    Divides the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y).
    Splits data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using train_test_split.

6. Model Building

    Training:
        Builds a RandomForestClassifier to predict the credit mix.
        Trains the model using the training data.

7. Evaluation

    Performance Metrics:
        Outputs classification metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
        Confusion matrix to assess prediction performance.


b.Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Product Reviews

This file implements a machine learning pipeline to classify sentiment (positive or negative) of Amazon product reviews. Below is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Dataset Overview

    Dataset Description: The dataset contains:
        reviewText: Textual product reviews.
        Positive: Target column with binary labels (1 for positive sentiment, 0 for negative sentiment).
    Objective: Predict the sentiment of a review based on its textual content.

2. Data Preprocessing

    Tasks:
        Text Preprocessing:
            Converts text to lowercase.
            Removes punctuation, stop words, and special characters.
            Tokenizes the text into words.
            Applies lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.
        Dataset Splitting:
            Splits the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.
        TF-IDF Vectorization:
            Transforms text data into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) for machine learning.

    Code Snippets:
        preprocess_text() function processes each review to clean and lemmatize it.
        The cleaned text is stored in a new column, cleaned_text.
        The data is split into X (features) and y (target) and further into training (X_train, y_train) and testing sets.

3. Model Selection

    Selected Models:
        Logistic Regression: A simple linear model for binary classification.
        Random Forest: An ensemble model combining decision trees for better performance and robustness.
        Support Vector Machine (SVM): A model that uses hyperplanes to classify data, effective for high-dimensional spaces.

    Steps:
        TF-IDF features are generated for both training and test data.
        Each model is trained using fit() and tested using predict().

4. Model Evaluation

    Metrics Used:
        Accuracy: Measures the percentage of correctly predicted instances.
        Precision: Fraction of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.
        Recall: Fraction of true positives among all actual positives.
        F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

    Evaluation:
        classification_report() provides detailed performance metrics for each model.
        Output includes metrics for both 0 (negative sentiment) and 1 (positive sentiment).
   

c.Time-Series Forecasting of Carbon Monoxide (CO) and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO₂) Levels

1. Importing Libraries

        tensorflow.keras: For building LSTM models.
        sklearn: For evaluation metrics.

2. Loading the Dataset

    Description: A CSV file containing air quality data is loaded directly from a URL.
    Output: The first few rows of the dataset are displayed.

3. Data Preprocessing

    Combines Date and Time columns into a datetime index for time-series analysis.
    Resamples the data to daily averages and handles missing values using forward fill.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    Visualization: Time-series plots for CO and NO₂ levels, highlighting historical trends.
    Seasonal Decomposition: Breaks down the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components for both pollutants.
